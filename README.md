# Personal Website v3.0

This is the third iteration of my personal website built using NextJS, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity.io. I know, this is the third iteration of my website in less than a year, but it's more of a visual design overhaul than a technology overhaul. 

Come check it out at [olivergao.org](https://olivergao.com) where you'll learn a little bit about me, my projects, and some blog posts I wrote.
